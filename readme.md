# rrdinfo-parser.py

This script, originally written by [Laban Mwangi](http://andorian.blogspot.fr/2011/02/rrdinfo-parser.html) tries to figure out the original rrdtool create parameters that were used to create a given rrd. It's very basic and expects rrdtool to be your path. This version can be used with Python 2.7/3.x.
